# SentimentAnalysis-ResearchPaper
– In this study, we have used diverse machine learning classification algorithms to conduct sentiment analysis using a unique dataset of 50,000 review entries. The dataset is put under heavy preprocessing before being used by any algorithm to eliminate needless words in the reviews. We have tested many classification algorithms in an effort to obtain the best results such as Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Extra Tree Classifier. All the algorithms are then put through a Voting Classification algorithm to aggregate the results put out by all the base algorithms. Moreover, we modeled a Feed Forward Neural Network Engine on the side to draw a clear comparison. The data in the Neural Network runs through multiple layers, getting optimized in the process to report the best results.
